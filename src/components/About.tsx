        confronted with truly difficult decisions, choices with consequences we know will be life-changing. At the end

        That's where decidio comes in. To help you get to the end of that long decision making process, decidio helps
        you enumerate all of the relevant factors and then plots visualizations that help you come to terms with your

        help you start to overcome uncertainty.
