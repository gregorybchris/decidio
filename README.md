## About

We make thousands of small choices every day. And most of the time we actually have the winning option picked out before we're fully aware that there's even a choice to be made. But a few times in our lives we're confronted with truly difficult decisions, choices with consequences we know will be life-changing. At the end of the day, we choose the path that feels right, but getting to a place where anything feels right can be a long process.

That's where decidio comes in. To help you get to the end of that long decision making process, decidio helps you enumerate all of the relevant factors and then plots visualizations that help you come to terms with your preferences. Only you can know which choice feels right, but by making your preferences explicit decidio will help you start to overcome uncertainty.

## What it really is

Decidio is a souped-down spreadsheet with formulas that you can't change :) After inputting your options and the criteria that matter to you Decidio forces you assign weights to your criteria. This is often something that we do only unconsciously. By explicitly stating our criteria weighting we quickly begin to grapple with what matters to us.

Then after rating each option given our new framework we're presented with the simple weighted scores for our choices. Step two of the Decidio process is trying to make sense of our own ratings. By seeing the final ratings we tend to have one of two gut reactions. The first is something like "yeah of course that's my first choice, but now that I see it in numbers I feel better about it." The second is more common and also more satisfying: "This feels wrong, I should update my criteria and weights." The concrete feedback loop of getting the visual to match our gut feeling is the most valuable part of the Decidio method. I hope it works for you.
